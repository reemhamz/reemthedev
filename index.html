    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>25 y/o data analyst switching to web development. I've worked in data analysis for nearly two years now, straight after graduating university. However, found myself to have gotten pretty burnt out by data science and where it was leading. Especially because it's such a broad and undefined field, and having not had a proper mentor to guide me through the valley of ill-identified streams, I felt as if I was very alone and thought it was best for my happiness to go into something a bit more defined with a larger, more open community.</p>
    <p>I'm currently going through the <a href="https://www.100daysofcode.com/">#100daysofcode challenge</a> on Twitter. I may not be able to code every waking day for 100 days, but I'll be documenting all the days I actually do code and get far.

<h2>More Exciting Things</h2>

      <h3>My coding journey</h3>

      <p>I started learning to code back in 2017 when I needed to utilize Python to automate some tasks at work. I would be lying if I claimed to enjoy it. However, fast-forward a year and I find myself using Python and SQL to automate even more tasks at my new job. Those two previous positions were for data analysts. I realized pretty quickly how burnt out I got while working wiith data and decided to try web development. A major difference between coding for data and coding for web dev is that you get to be creative and put your own spin on things with web development; not to mention being able to have more concrete results the moment you refresh your page.</p>
      <p>I decided then to study web development full-time while working as a barista. It's been challenging to code full-time because of such a busy schedule, but this dedication is also helping me learn the dark art of discipline. </p>

      <h3>On being a coffee afficianado</h3>

      <p>I've had a passion for coffee making since middle school. I was always into the art of making speciality coffee and the positive social effects it has on communities. It brings people from all backgrounds together in a neat and peaceful coffee shop where they can socialize and enjoy a nice cuppa joe. Having a coffee shop of my own is the ultamite goal.</p>
      <p>That said, I'm currently working as a barista in a speciality coffee shop in Lebanon, which brings a very unqiue and exciting twist to the coffee that the country has been used to for decades (Nescafé and turkish coffee). Needless to say it's been a beautiful experience so far. You can follow my latte art portfolio <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reems_latte/?hl=en">here</a>.</p>

    <div class="reading">

<h3>Reading for an intellectual breakthrough</h3>

<p>Growing up, I would usually only pick up the popular fiction novels such as Harry Potter series or the Twilight saga (no ragrets, not even one). However, when I started university in 2012, I didn't give myself a chance to read any novels, not even a tiny book for that matter, as I thought it was a waste of time. Fast forward to 2015 where I went back to reading more adult fiction books (no, not <em>those adult fiction books</em>) and was pretty enthralled by the style and word selections by the mature authors. I later took it upon myself to dive into the realm of some non-fiction and extensive fiction (i.e. Stephen King). Ever since then, I've noticed positive differences in my personality, proving to myself that I was able to grow in some way once I've finished a book, not to mention having much more of an opinionated mindset. Overall, reading, as most of you may already know, can change a person's life for the better. </p>
<p>Hence, I made it a mission in 2019 to read as many books as I can. Although my time management is basically horrible since I'm also balancing a night shift at the coffee shop and studying coding in the morning. It's all about finding that sweet spot for reading!</p>
